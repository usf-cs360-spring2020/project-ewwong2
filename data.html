  <p>
    The data was taken from the
    <a href="https://myusf.usfca.edu/dashboard">USF Banner Self Service</a>.
    This is an option from the dashboard and is only available to students and
    faculty at the
    <a href="https://www.usfca.edu/">University of San Francisco</a>.

    The smart choice would have been to ask for the API or the data in a more
    succinct form. Instead, I took the unnecessarily long and totally
    unnecessary route. I took each of the list of courses for each semester from
    2008 and 2020 and put it through
    <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a>.
    This required a significant amount of cleaning. Then I fetched all of the
    catalog entries from a constructed URL. My python f-string ended up looking
    like this:
    `https://ssb-prod.ec.usfca.edu/PROD/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in={row["Year"]}{term_id}0&subj_code_in={row["Subj"]}&crse_numb_in={row["Crse"]}`.
    This URL apparently does not require authentication. Then I used a
    combination of regex and
    <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">Beautiful Soup</a>
    to parse out the parts that I wanted and added this to the dataframe. Along
    the way I learned that there were 100,000+ rows across the years, so adding
    data for each row from a URL GET request was taking much too long. So I had
    to switch to multi-threading. After quite some time of fumbling over the
    code, I was able to use
    <a href="https://dask.org/">Dask</a>
    to multi-thread some of my code. All this is to say that my spaghetti code
    in
    <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebooks</a>
    did not work. It ended with some issues such as courses with no department
    or different formatting, but it was able to pull some interesting data. If
    it is interesting, I can clean up the code in my Jupyter Notebook a bit and
    share this on GitHub.

    The goal is to parse this data even more to build the dependencies
    (prerequisites) and be able to build a dependency graph.
