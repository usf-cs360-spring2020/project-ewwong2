The range of texts we thus characterize as \"early British literature\" is staggering, and part of our goal in this course will simply be to appreciate the sheer volume and breadth of written work created in Britain and Ireland between the eighth and eighteenth centuries. We will do this through a necessarily selective sampling of historical periods, languages, and genres.
