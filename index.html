    This site aims to dive deeper into the courses offered at the
    <a href="https://www.usfca.edu/">University of San Francisco</a>.
    Although I am a student at the
    <a href="https://www.usfca.edu/">University of San Francisco</a>,
    I never bothered
    to look depper into the statistics of the school beyond the pamphlet given
    to me in freshman year.

    Over the course of my undergraduate years, I have
    always had issues with registration whether it be limited course capacity,
    prerequisite, hold, or restriction that I needed to get resolved. While
    this website will not and cannot be the solution to that problem, I am
    hoping to explore different ways to present information that could have
    helped me back then. As a graduate student now, I have much less issues with
    registration, but perhaps the ideas in the site could be used to either
    gain insight on the course system or help with registration.
