  <h3>Question</h3>
  <p>
    The question this visualization aims to answer is broadly "What courses do I
    need to take in order to take this other course?". The specific course or
    courses will depend on the person using the visualization and filters.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="mt-4">
  <h3>Answer</h3>
  <p>
    This visualization is aimed more towards data exploration so without
    selecting any courses, it doesn't really answer any question. If we look at
    a specific question though, such as "What do I need to take in order to take
    Interactive Computer Graphics (CS 418)?". We can select this course and see
    that we would need to take alot of courses. From the schedule tile, we can
    see that we would need to take: CS 225 and (MATH 225 or MATH 415) and MATH
    241. Each of those requirements have their own requirements though. All the
    requirements and the requirements for the requirements can be seen in the
    graph.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="mt-4">
  <h3>Encoding</h3>
  <p>
    The data only shows Spring 2020 courses. Color encodes the subject. A node
    represents a course. A directed link represents a dependency from one course
    to another course. This can be a variety of different link types such as
    prerequisites or corerequisites.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="mt-4">
  <h3>Interactivity</h3>
  <p>
    The graph can be filtered by courses. This can be done by choosing one or
    more courses in the "Course Selection" tile. Ctrl + Click to select multiple.
    Shift + Click to select and range.
  </p>
  <p>
    This will update the graph to
    show the dependencies for those courses. The next paragraph will explain
    how this works. Details on demand are also provided as a seperate tile under
    the course selection. This is to prevent sporadic graph loading and
    obscuring the graph with a tooltip. An interactivity that has not been
    implemented yet is double click to add the course as to the course selection.
  </p>
  <p>
    Selecting a course is actually starting a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search">Depth First Search</a>
    for each "root" (course). This will add each course in the DFS to the graph
    and include the corresponding links.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="mt-4">
  <h3>Wrangling</h3>
  <p>
    Details about data wrangling can be found
    <a href="{{ "/data.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">here</a>.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="mt-4">
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    It is really interesting to see how the dependency graph grows. While it
    seems self explanatory that higher division course will have larger trees,
    it seems that there are quite a free higher division courses that have no
    prerequisites at all. There are also quite a few courses with special
    requirements such as permission from the instructor.
