        <b>Caption:</b> The first visualization is a calendar inspired by a
        <a href="https://codepen.io/jey/pen/jmClJ">Gantt chart</a>. This shows
        the course sections that have been selected. The second visualiation is
        a force directed graph. It shows course dependencies. More information
        about the data can be found

  <h3>Encoding</h3>
  <p>
    The data only shows 2020 courses excluding winter courses from the
    University of Illinois. Color encodes the subject. A node represents a
    course. A directed link represents a dependency from one course
    to another course. This can be a variety of different link types such as
    prerequisites or corerequisites.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="mt-4">
  <h3>Interactivity Instructions</h3>
  <p>
    Start by chosing a course from the search. If you are interested in learning
    about "circuits", you can enter this in the search to see what is offered.
  </p>
  <img src="{{ "/assets/images/search.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" width=500 style="border-radius: 5px; border: 1px dashed gainsboro;"/>
  <p>
    We can see that there are multiple circuit courses offered. Let's select the
    first one. We are now presented with section options of the course across 3
    semesters.
  </p>
  <img src="{{ "/assets/images/sections.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" width=500 style="border-radius: 5px; border: 1px dashed gainsboro;"/>
  <p>
    After we chose a section, the calendar updates to the section chosen. The
    chart also shows the dependencies of the course and their dependencies. At
    this point, we can choose to remove a section, add another section from search,
    add a section from the dependency graph, or view conflicts.
  </p>

  <h3>Interactivity Implemented</h3>
  <p>
    The graph can be filtered by course(s). This version scraps the original
    multi select input. Trading off data exploration for practicality, a search
    by title, course id, and description was added. This supports selecting a
    particular section and semester of a course. This choice is then added to
    the schedule list that supports removing sections. This choice is also added
    to the Gantt inspired calendar and the force directed graph.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to accomodate courses that do not have a fixed time or will have a
    time arranged later, a "No Section" selection is provided that will be added
    to the graph but not the calendar.
  </p>
  <p>
    The calendar supports brushing. To highlight the course section, other
    courses will have a lower opacity when brushing.
  </p>
  <p>
    A tooltip is also provided for the calendar. This tooltip provides more
    information about the section in the calendar.
  </p>
  <p>
    The graph has a basic outline when hovered over as well as detail on demand
    positioned in the top right in order to limit obstruction of the graph.
  </p>
  <p>
    The graph updates to show the dependencies for the chosen courses. The next
    paragraph will explain how this works.
  </p>
  <p>
    Selecting a course is actually starting a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search">Depth First Search</a>
    for each "root" (course). This will add each course in the DFS to the graph
    and include the corresponding links. This prevents a cluttered view.
  </p>
  <p>
    The graph also supports adding sections from the context menu. Simply right
    click on a course to add this to the schedule, calendar, and graph.
  </p>
  <p>
    The tags below the "Schedule" title also show the credits hours range of the
    selected sections including "No Section" and also lists course conflicts.
    These conflicts are shown in red with a red border around the offending
    courses.

  <h3>Wrangling</h3>
  <p>
    Details about data wrangling can be found
    <a href="{{ "/data.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">here</a>.

<div class="mt-4">
  <h3>Caveats</h3>
  <p>
    I was unable to find structured data for prerequisites specifically, so it
    was ultimately decided not to represent part of the information and
    misrepresent the rest. In specific, it was originally planned to give
    corerequisites a different link color. However, it seems that there are an
    arbitrary amount of ways to explain this in English: "concurrent
    registration in", "concurrent registration in the other", "concurrent
    registration in either course", and more. This is also coupled with the use
    of "and" and "or". This visualization also fails to encode "and" and "or"
    relations and leads to some false negatives. If there is enough interest, I
    have ideas on how to parse this. Otherwise, each link will broadly encode a
    dependency that can be explored further through the schedule or node details.
  </p>
  <p>
    If there is an interest for this, I would love to explore this project
    further including better parsing, offset course overlaps, corerequisites,
    <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/XavierGimenez/a8e8c5e9aed71ba96bd52332682c0399">grouped force directed nodes</a>
    to show "and" vs "or", integration with major
    and minor curriculum, and a filter for the search.
  </p>

  <h3>Findings</h3>
  <p>
    It is really interesting to see how the dependency graph grows. While it
    seems self explanatory that higher division course will have larger trees,
    it seems that there are quite a few higher division courses that have no
    prerequisites at all. There are also quite a few courses with special
    requirements such as permission from the instructor. It is easy to see how
    certain classes connect to one another by adding them into the visualization.
