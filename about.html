  <h3 class="title is-3">Why?</h3>
  <p>
    I am a student at the
    <a href="https://www.usfca.edu/">University of San Francisco</a>.
    I have had some struggles with course registration in the past, so I am sure
    my past self would have appreciated any attempts at aiding or simplifying
    the registration process. While I am unable to use the course data for my
    own university, I am hoping the same ideas and techniques will be able to be
    applied to different universities (other than the University of Illinois data).
