  <h3 class="title is-3">Why?</h3>
  <p>
    If it is not clear at this point, I am a student at the
    <a href="https://www.usfca.edu/">University of San Francisco</a>.
    So this topic directly relates. While I will be graduating relatively soon,
    it would be nice if this site could help anyone else at the University. It
    should be noted that raw statistics will likely serve the purpose of this
    site better for many questions. However, certain things are harder to show.
    For example, a visualization I hoping to be able to create is a force
    directed dependency graph showing the prerequisite of each course.

        I am a 4+1 Computer Science student at University of San Francisco. I
        have completed my Bachelors in Computer Science on December 2019 and
        will complete my Masters degree on December 2020. I am currently
        learning about Machine Learning, Data Visualizations, and streaming
        data. I am also always very enthusiastic to learn more about new tech
        products.
