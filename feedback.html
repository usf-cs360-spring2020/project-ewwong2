        <td>
          A legend was added to the graph that shifts upwards as more subjects
          are added to the graph.

          From asking peers for additional feedback, I heard that the multi
          select is too short and does not show enough courses.
        </td>
        <td>
          I did not have enough space to make this longer, so I opted to replace
          this with a search bar. This would provide more context about the
          class than just the course id.

          From live synchronous feedback, one feedback was that I may need
          another visualization for a higher grade.
        </td>
        <td>
          I pulled in more data from the dataset to get section information.
          Then I created a calendar in D3 inspired by a Gantt chart example.

          From live synchronous feedback, another feedback was to show the path
          between two courses if a path exists.
        </td>
        <td>
          I opted not to follow through with this feedback. I could not find a
          plausible use case for this that fits the narrative. While I can see
          how a student would want to see the prerequisites of a course, I can't
          think of a student that would need to check if a specific course connects
          to another specific course.

        <td>
          From additional feedback from peers, I was told that the site was a
          little hard to figure out how to use. I was suggested to
          add hints in the search bar and start with a starting course.
        </td>
        <td>
          I added some images as well as a more streamlined interactivity
          instructions in the writeup. I also started with a course and added
          search suggestions in the search bar.

          From additional feedback from peers, I was suggested to create a more
          structured version of the graph to make it easier to read.
        </td>
        <td>
          This will not be included in the final version of this visualization.
          However, future work might include a force directed tree that can have
          duplicate nodes as a toggle option for the graph.
